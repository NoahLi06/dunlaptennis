            <h3>The Aces For Arian Tournament will be held again in 2023, in honor of former Dunlap Eagle and USC Trojan Arian Rahbar.<br> Arian passed away due to senseless street racing in December of 2021. 
                Rahbar was a member of the Winning 2017 Dunlap Tennis team and qualified<br> for state two times after.
                 On the court, he was known for his 
                quick speed and punishing forehands. Off the court, he was a phenomenal and intelligent person. <br>
            </h3>
            <h2>Arian's fighting spirit with live on as we gather to play the sport he loved.</h2>

            <h4>Registration will be coming soon!</h4>
