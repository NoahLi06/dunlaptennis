            <h3>Arian Rahbar (DHS class of 2019) achieved an impressive 4-year high school career playing for the Dunlap Eagles Tennis Team. Arian is part of an elite group of Dunlap Tennis players in the 100 win club,<br> and is a 3-time IHSA State qualifier. This includes being a special part of the 2017 1A Team State Championship Eagles Tennis Team! Also a 3-time selection on the Mid-Illini <br>All-Conference team, Arian is 1 of only 13 Dunlap men to qualify for the State Tournament in both Singles and Doubles.<br><br>

              Arian's positivity radiates on and off the court. Graduating from DHS with a nearly perfect GPA, he took his talents to study Computer Science at USC in Los Angeles.<br> His diligence earned him an upcoming summer internship at Facebook following his Junior year.<br><br>
              
              Arian tragically lost his life in December 2021 as a pedestrian victim to senseless street racing in LA. Let us come together for the second straight year <br> as a Dunlap community to enjoy some summer tennis as Arian would, playing to his heart’s content on the court.<br> After all, Arian was one of the first champions of this tournament (doubles) - formerly called the Eagle Classic!
            </h3>
            <h3>Arian's fighting spirit with live on as we gather to play the sport he loved.</h3>
